# Introduction

`run_analysis.R`is part of the Project Assignment of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning data course. It performs the 5 steps required.

* Part 1 merges data tables with rbind.
* Part 2 extracts only the columns related to mean and standard deviation. Column names are also changed according to `features.txt`.
* Part 3 takes the activity names and IDs from `activity_labels.txt` to be replaced in the data table.
* Part 4 merges all data tables and adjusts labels.
* Part 5 creates a new dataset with the averages for each subject and activity type.
